# Vehicle_Classifier

This project is a Vehicle Classifier that classifies,
1) Mototbikes
2) Airplanes
3) Schooner

To execute the file you need to import the notebook in Kaggle and also import the necessary data as well in order to make sure the model works perfectly. The main contribution in this project is usage of Adam an optimizer of Tensorflow instead of Adamax to increase the accuracy.
